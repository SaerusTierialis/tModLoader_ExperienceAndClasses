This mod introduces an RPG-style class and leveling system where all monsters provide experience based on their health, defense, and damage stats. Your current level and progression is presented in a movable UI box. As you level, you unlock various bonuses and progress through three tiers of classes with several choices along the way.

See forum for full patch notes.

v1.1.6
-class tokens can now only be equipped in the vanilla accessory slots (prevents many bugs and exploits when using other mods) 
-update token description when unequipped 
-hide the ClassToken template 
-auras now work as you'd expect in pvp (don't buff or heal enemies, do harm them) 
-defense aura now applies to friendly NPC 
-life aura now shows healing on friendly NPC 
-if there are multiple defense auras in a region, you can now see a buff indicator for each tier (but still only get the highest-tier buff) 
-code cleanup and optimizations (done enough, more in next version)
-auras now all use a general method (future auras will be easier/faster to implement and less likely to contain bugs) 
-Experience Orbs can now stack to 9,999,999 even if you have MaxStacks installed 
-Berserker damage reduced to 0.25%/level (from 0.75%/level) 
-Warrior damage reduced to 1%/level (from 1.25%/level) 
-fix reload bug
-fix aura buffs break when reloading mods

-remove scope from tier III range classes 
-multiclass assassin bug (sometimes opener doesn't work depending on token order and positions) 
-add dodge chance to Rogue, Assassin, and Ninja 
-add brief invulnerability after opener attack (excluding "free" opener attacks against full-life targets) 
-make opener easier to use with projectile melee weapons (i.e., opener can trigger from melee hit shortly after the projectile hits)
-opener attack dust effect now becomes noticeable more quickly 
-add light to saint 
-changes to prevent other potential reload issues
-fixed a potential multiclass bug with bonus melee crit damage
-percent midas now stacks when multiclassing

v1.1.5
-Mac/Linux could not run version v1.1.4, this issue has been resolved
-reworded Ascension/Boss Orb message to state that the orb has dropped

v1.1.4
-add /expnoauth to toggle the need for auth on a map (must be used in single player mode and then load the map in multiplayer)
-all command should now state "Invalid command or parameter." when bad parameters are given
-disable /expcraft and /expuse (you can convert existing orbs into higher-value orbs for quick consumption) these are causing more trouble than they are worth
-implement direct crafting of all Experience Orbs at workbench using earned experience as a replacement for /expcraft, this is done at any Campfire (to prevent confusion with other Experience Orb recipes)
-have Ascension and Boss orbs craft into Exp Orb 100s instead of 1s (adjust exchange at each tier to 100/200, 300/600, 500/1000, 1000/2000)
-fixed an exploitable crafting bug
-current settings are now displayed upon entering a map
-write auth to console every 2min (from 1min)

v1.1.3
-expauth codes are now shorter
-multiplayer exprate and expclasscaps are now saved to maps (i.e., you do not have to set these each time you put up the map)
-disable "A healed B for x" message in Life Aura
-added a workaround for an issue with /expcraft large values
-fix Hybrid II Midas Debuff rate (from 5% to 0.5%)

v1.1.2
-multiclassing is now possible by equipping multiple tokens, but effective level is divided (e.g., a level 50 with two classes is level 25 in each)
-fixed a bug that could prompt the "You have gained/lost x experience." message each time ANYONE gains experience in multiplayer
-Ascension Orb recipe: heart crystal + mana crystal + 20 gold/platinum bars
-can now gain experience and view experience bar without a token equipped
-can now craft Experience Orbs into x100, x1000, x10000, x100000, and x1000000 for faster command-free consumption (not consumed by /expuse)
-manual consumption of Experience Orbs is a faster animation
-fixed a possible crash from invalid command arguments
-new personal setting /explvlcap # to limit gaining experience past the specified level (will move to config file if that is implemented later), works in multiplayer (not global, set to -1 to disable, disabled by default)
-new personal setting /expdmgred # to limit bonus damage stats (0-100, 0% reduction is normal, 50% reduction is half, 100% reduction is no bonus damage), works in multiplayer (not global); affects damage, attack speed, and critical rate (set to -1 or 0 to disable, disabled by default)
-reorganized packet sender functions (performance improvement + less likely to introduce bugs)

v1.1.1
-no actual changes, just updated the description

v1.1.0
-class tokens can no longer gain a prefix when crafted although the text above your head may include one (you can still add/change prefix)
-Ascension Orb drop rate increased to 1/150 (from 1/200)
-Ascension Orb and Boss Orb rate of exchange for experience now varies with current class Tier (125/250, 250/500, 500/1000, and then 1000/2000 at level 50+ of Tier III)
-individual exprate is no longer applied in multiplayer (uses global rate instead)
-individual ignore class caps is no longer applied in multiplayer (uses global bool instead)
-fixed a bug that could allow Saint to have level 2 and level 3 Defense Aura
-fixed a bug where Cleric Ichor Aura debuff lasted slightly too long
-Saint Life Aura now heals friendly NPCs too
-added announcements for finding Ascension Orb, Boss Orb, levelup, leveldown, craft Tier II, craft Tier III
-when a player acquires the mod by joining a server that uses it, the experience bar visibility bug should no longer occur and the player will be given a Novice Token to start (if they have room)
-tiers in class token names changed to roman numerals
-timing converted from ticks to milliseconds, no longer affected by pausing time with HERO's mod
-assassin operner attack can trigger every 2000milliseconds (and on any hits aginst full-life targets)
-periodic effects trigger every 5000milliseconds
-Ichor Aura duration adjusted to fit new trigger interval
-Saint Ichor Aura duration is now nearly twice Cleric
-several optimizations with auras
-all timing now uses real time instead of in-game ticks (more reliable, doesn't stop when pausing with HERO's mod)
-new command /expbarreset will reset the position, visibility, and transparency of experience bar
-Ascension Orb now also drop from monsters that give 1 experience (e.g., early slimes)
-multiplayer now has a auth feature, the code will display in the console, players can enter /expauth <code> to gain auth, enter /auth to check your status
-functions that adjust experience, rates, or class caps now require auth in multiplayer
-when a server is brought online, exprate defaults to 100%, ignore class caps defaults to FALSE, and authentications are reset
-many optimizations and organizations (too many to list)
-server now handles the experience in multiplayer (so many internal changes)
-to prevent potential experience reset bugs, the server cannot change an experience value until the player's initial sync is complete. the initial sync should occur within 500 msec of connection and repeats until successful. if, somehow, the sync is not possible then a server-wide warning messages will be sent out each time the server tries and fails to alter your experience value. if this ever happens, relogging will probably fix whatever is happening (please also report it to me)
-memory usage should be around 0.5mb highers
